dh-elpa (1.12) experimental; urgency=medium

  This version of dh_elpa uses a more restricted load-path for
  byte-compilation than previous versions. In particular by default it
  only looks at the directories searched by emacs --quick, and installed
  dh_elpa based packages.  There are two solutions for maintainers of
  packages with non-elpa-* dependencies. A long term solution is to
  convince the maintainers of your dependencies to use dh_elpa; a local
  fix is to add an --emacs-loadpath option to debian/rules. See
  dh_elpa(1) for details.

dh-elpa (0.0.20) unstable; urgency=medium

  This version of dh_elpa will try to run any ERT and Buttercup test
  suites that it can find if you set the debhelper compat level to 10
  or above.  If you are currently running your package's test suite
  with a override_dh_auto_test stanza in debian/rules, or if there
  exists an upstream test suite that you are not running, dh_elpa will
  override any override_dh_auto_test stanza and try to run the test
  suite.  If it can't run it in its default configuration, this will
  lead to your package failing to build from source.

  The easy fix is to add a line like this to the top of your debian/rules:

      export DH_AUTO_TEST_DISABLE

  If instead you would like to migrate to have dh_elpa run your test
  suite and it fails to do so in its default configuration, see
  dh_elpa_test(1) for how to configure dh_elpa_test to run the test
  suite successfully.
