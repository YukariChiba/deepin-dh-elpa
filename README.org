* Intro

This is a work-in progress project to generate Debian packages of
Emacs Lisp extensions that integrate with the built in (since GNU
Emacs 24.1) package system package.el. This means that debian packages
built with this tool will show up in M-x list-packages, and that user
installs of more up to date packages will override them (for that
user!). Perhaps the most important improvement is that no file
/etc/emacs/site-start.d is needed for such a package.

* Limitations

- This tool is currently not very well tested.

- Currently all of the emacs lisp files are installed into one
  directory; this might break packages that do fancier things with
  load-path.

- package.el gets confused if you have both a system and a user elpa
  package and refuses to delete the user one unless you delete the
  system one first.
